1/8/25, 2:35 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I think Thursday or Saturday will be good for this, what do you think?
You could choose the time and chose amongst one of those days
1/8/25, 2:38 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Okay, I think Saturday is the best even
1/8/25, 2:39 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yes. please if at any moment you feel like you can't handle it or would not have time it will be ok to leave it, you really need a break. It will not be good to stress you, cause we will not use any ChatGPT or any AI and we resource just with what you know.
1/8/25, 2:39 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah as it's a weekend.
1/8/25, 2:40 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Or better still choose a random problem on Thursday and prepare ahead of Saturday individually

1/11/25, 11:32 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Can we start with that stuff today?
1/11/25, 11:34 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: You intend starting this January?? Please next month I'm ony project at the moment and the entire month,
1/11/25, 11:36 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Actually I don't really see how that will disturb the progress of your project especially if it will be just max 3h per week.

Moreover it could just serve as little extra brain boost.
1/11/25, 11:36 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But it's still okay if it will not be easy for you
1/11/25, 11:36 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: By the way how far have you gone with it?
1/11/25, 11:38 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I'm actually under pressure to wrap up this January, and I won't like committing to something and not participating. I'm literally unstable with my time this January
1/11/25, 11:39 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: The backend is giving me headaches and I'm almost done with the front end
1/11/25, 11:40 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: How much work have you done and how much is left?
1/11/25, 11:41 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Exactly 50%
1/11/25, 11:41 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Have you been writing report side by side
1/11/25, 11:41 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Not bad
1/11/25, 11:41 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Yup everything, including the PowerPoint
1/11/25, 11:44 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Ok good
1/11/25, 11:45 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: What is the issue in the backend
1/11/25, 11:48 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Everything
1/11/25, 11:49 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Mother, please state them how you are feeling them
1/11/25, 11:49 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I've got this
1/11/25, 11:50 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I don't necessarily mean being involved, I just mean listing them out
1/11/25, 11:50 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: It helps in a way

I don't do spring boot so I will most likely not be able to help
1/11/25, 11:51 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Connecting to the database, password encryption, and building an algorithm for the attendance display and submission
1/11/25, 11:53 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Do you also need authentication and authorization or it has already been implemented
1/11/25, 11:53 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: It's been implemented
1/11/25, 11:54 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Do you have any idea of how this usually works (don't think code wise)
1/11/25, 11:58 AM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Well not completely, that's why it's really a challenge
1/11/25, 11:59 AM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Explain the little you know I can see how to fill in the gaps
1/11/25, 12:01 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Well that UI has built and to connect with the database to collect and retrieve information, linking has to be done using the typescript component of the UI and spring boot user service along with security configuration
1/11/25, 12:04 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Do you already have your database designed?
1/11/25, 12:05 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Well partially, I'm still testing out different possibilities on the design, because one of the Devs did a review and suggested some changes
1/11/25, 12:07 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Ok
1/11/25, 12:07 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: What dbms are you using?
1/11/25, 12:07 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Postgresql
1/11/25, 12:11 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: <Media omitted>
1/11/25, 12:13 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: For display and submission is just handling post and get requests

1/11/25, 12:19 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: How many chapters of your reports have you written so far

1/11/25, 12:19 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: 5, Dr sop
1/11/25, 3:55 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Mom, did your parent go to Limbe on the 28th of November last year?
1/11/25, 4:00 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I don't think so eh
1/11/25, 4:03 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Just that it has been long, but was there anytime they traveled during that period?
1/11/25, 5:05 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Yeah
1/11/25, 5:06 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: My mother? Cause I look nothing like my father in an obvious for someone to recognise
1/11/25, 5:08 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: You deleted this message

1/11/25, 5:40 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Nope no mile 4
1/11/25, 5:40 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: The way you emphasized that you don't resemble your dad just made me bring this 😅

3/10/25, 6:33 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I used to have the worst impression of people from boarding school, and just avoid any interaction with them, you're so different
3/10/25, 6:34 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: So start avoiding me 😅😅😆
3/10/25, 6:35 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: So you'd really allow me to be backhanded ??😂😭

I love properties, and so I'm claiming you by force
3/10/25, 6:35 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: 😂😂😂 when you give me a valid reason to, then I will avoid you
3/10/25, 6:36 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I have been taking long time ago and I don't like to be shared. Let one person have me and let peace reign
3/10/25, 6:36 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I mean I don't longer hate them in quotes, it's part of growing up
3/10/25, 6:36 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Wowww 😂, it's alright. I've learning to let go off recently so okay
3/10/25, 6:37 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: For like 7 years now I have had the feeling like I eat my twin (elder) sister in the placenta

3/10/25, 6:40 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: With the way my mom lived and I grew up around her, I thought and at some point believed and hoped that she had other children before me. And Hell yeah she did Diana and Yannick. But the gap was to much
3/10/25, 6:41 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I don't understand
3/10/25, 6:41 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: <Media omitted>
3/10/25, 6:41 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: *voice mail

3/10/25, 6:45 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: After my and Yannick stared falling apart in 2004
3/10/25, 6:46 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I see, why
3/10/25, 6:50 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Na I love mondays
3/10/25, 6:50 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yannick is still my favorite just that during that time I started getting more attached to Diana and Yannick got busier with exams. If I see it as a similie it was like I was just cheating on Yannick with Diana (Actually Nadia) for sometime while Yannick was not around and he was gone for sometime with his mom (Beatrice). We were left just 2 of us at home. Charles to at the time was just going and coming back and fulling me with sweet and good things
3/10/25, 6:51 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I have gotten use to 😏
3/10/25, 6:52 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Sorry caused by network 😅
3/10/25, 6:52 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Haha okay
3/10/25, 6:53 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Life happens right, wait is Ma'am Beatrice not your mum as well
3/10/25, 6:54 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: That thing really passed me I don't even know how she managed. But she really got to be strong and I love that strength.

Cause that her situation made me remember of when I started my internship and my dad had to be operated. I was doing my tasks and attending meetings while I was taking care of him in the hospital. And I had a program I was following which has put in a position which I do not know whether I will call it good or great or bad situation. But I passed those phases well despite being busy with taking care of my dad and doing internship at 2 companies
3/10/25, 6:54 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah she is
3/10/25, 6:55 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But she was his in particular long before I came to life. Since 1996
3/10/25, 6:56 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Alright then, so it means I owned my parents before my siblings haha
3/10/25, 6:57 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Why were you working at 2 companies over sabi 🙄

But yeah, you people are so strong. I guess we all are cause
3/10/25, 6:57 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Actually I have not considered her as my mom for even a quarter of my life and she too has said it. That's why I sometime say the woman that gave birth to me
3/10/25, 6:57 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Any problem or reason??
3/10/25, 6:57 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: She was Yannick and Daina's mom before I came and now she is Augustine's mom
3/10/25, 6:58 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I had my reasons for doing so and it was so light for me
3/10/25, 6:58 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: No instead is for a lot of best reasons
3/10/25, 6:59 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Really, then why
3/10/25, 7:00 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But main thing you have to know is mothers consider their last children as their babies. Their all. And me I even make it worst by always telling my mom to the point of putting her pressure that my sister needs her so badly especially as she is a girl
3/10/25, 7:00 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: 😂😂 close this narrative, she is your mother and so stop calling her your siblings mom

In a way its disrespectful
3/10/25, 7:00 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Ok
3/10/25, 7:01 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I am sorry. but maybe it's because they always needed her more then me and truth be told they do
3/10/25, 7:01 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Especially if you know the depth of the story
3/10/25, 7:01 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Your mindset on this isn't the best and it gives room for the feeling of being one of her children instead being her child
3/10/25, 7:02 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I don't want to be selfish with her so I am just sharing her maybe
3/10/25, 7:02 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But they all know that when am around I am the one and only
3/10/25, 7:02 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: That's the thing I don't, so I apologize if I may not understand you completely
3/10/25, 7:03 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: From what you know and your point of view you are right
3/10/25, 7:03 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Be selfish, the good type of selfish. She is yours too
3/10/25, 7:03 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I'm always right na haha
3/10/25, 7:03 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: When I am with her my sisters do not near especially that little one born in September called Augustine
3/10/25, 7:04 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I am very selfish with my dad.
3/10/25, 7:05 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But I am the most special one especially to my mom. Even though I caused her a lot of pain even before I was born
3/10/25, 7:06 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Maybe I was raised differently but with a mindset like this you may not let people love or take care of you as their family , so you should strike a balance 

But like I said I think you know best about your family
3/10/25, 7:06 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Woww favourite child 🥳🥳🥳😭, it means you're the best that's lovely

3/10/25, 7:08 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Well let me just spit something. Remember I told you since 2009 I started leaving not with my mom. Well I have neen living with other people and my mom most of time will call me and ask how is your mother
3/10/25, 7:09 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Because I have been so close to them and lived long with that particular person become very closed to them and take them as my own mother till the point where even my own mother says "How is your mother"
3/10/25, 7:10 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: So it's actually because I have a lot of family (2) to the point where I can permit to let my sibblis have my mom
3/10/25, 7:10 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Siblings*
3/10/25, 7:11 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: It definitely just an expression
3/10/25, 7:12 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I am not saying there is somethings wrong with what you said you are absolutely right. Just wanted to clarify something
3/10/25, 7:12 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Well the more the merrier but it doesn't change the fact that she is your main mother
3/10/25, 7:12 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Yeah and I understand you a lot better
3/10/25, 7:12 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah I know she is always above but can't deny credit to someone it's due
3/10/25, 7:13 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Especially when you see them do it despite it being hard for them
3/10/25, 7:13 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Diana (Nadia) was born in 1986 and Yannick in 1989 and they started living with my mom in 1996
3/10/25, 7:14 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: That's true too
3/10/25, 7:16 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: My sister really needs my mother so she needs to have all her time me I was so close to my mother in fact like I said when am around her no one else matter so as I am far away let them enjoy her. I am coming back
3/10/25, 7:16 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Okay I see
3/10/25, 7:18 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Do you know about Ying and Yang <This message was edited>
3/10/25, 7:18 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: You make it sound depressing, you know your family boundaries. They are all your mothers. And how you choose to love them is definitely your choice. But there's nothing like a sibling needing a mother more, it's just that circumstances present options like that.
3/10/25, 7:19 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Nope
3/10/25, 7:23 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Good and bad, light and darkness. But no just joking even in nightmare I can't even think of that.
3/10/25, 7:24 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Which is why even at some point I was thinking with the way you are, you will really need an older twin. Who could be there for you just like you are there for others. I got you a Gemini 2003 but you said no 🥲.
3/10/25, 7:26 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I've always wished I had an elder sibling but I'm used to it, i just make acquaintances with older people. It really helps me

Okay fine, what's her name
3/10/25, 7:26 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Hmm alright
3/10/25, 7:26 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: This sounds like an attack 😅😅, but looking at the circumstance part, based on present circumstance my sister really needs her. Cause right now I just pleaded with my mom to spend more and more time with my sister cause most especially like I said she is a girl with her age she needs her more and its called sacrifice
3/10/25, 7:27 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: It was a boy. but you wanted to steal my own twin. God na me for gi you that backhand I swear
3/10/25, 7:27 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Past tense, is he now a girl
3/10/25, 7:28 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But it's like you want a sister I have heard I will go in search again
3/10/25, 7:28 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Well that's so thoughtful of you, and I know it's best since you say so and also based on everything you said
3/10/25, 7:29 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: No after you refused I had to leave that matter my Gimini sibling needed me at that time so all my effort was on them
3/10/25, 7:29 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: No, brother
3/10/25, 7:29 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Haha you haven't seen anything
3/10/25, 7:30 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I too love Gimini people who schooled with me in form 4 understand best
3/10/25, 7:31 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: You and Geminis
3/10/25, 7:31 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Ok if its a brother then good. you guys are very close twins, one year apart, one day apart and some hours apart
3/10/25, 7:33 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Cause my thought is (especially from my mom's esperience) you really need people to also be there for you full force
3/10/25, 7:33 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Okay oh. I'm actually not fully interested to be honest but I'm all ears
3/10/25, 7:33 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Exactly 💯
3/10/25, 7:34 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: If you are not interested, I cant tell you cause I don't want to give them hope especially after what they have been through
3/10/25, 7:35 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I'm not interested then. I wouldn't want to hurt any hope
3/10/25, 7:36 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Can you hurt a Gimini 😆😆, people who destroy especially that one 😅
3/10/25, 7:37 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But it's ok me am here for you no matter what
3/10/25, 7:37 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I think it wouldn't hurt getting to know the person what's his name
3/10/25, 7:38 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Let me tell him first then I will update you
3/10/25, 7:38 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I saw some article say that Geminis are heartbreakers
3/10/25, 7:38 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yes it's true
3/10/25, 7:38 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Wow you people book appointments for twins haha
3/10/25, 7:39 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Nope
3/10/25, 7:39 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But I know the reason why (Methologically)
3/10/25, 7:39 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I even need to go see my twin.
3/10/25, 7:40 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Go well oh
3/10/25, 7:40 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Lemme hear it
3/10/25, 7:41 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Libra's don't have their time
3/10/25, 7:41 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: After destroying they come to us for a talk
3/10/25, 7:42 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: After destroying what
3/10/25, 7:47 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Hearts 💔
3/10/25, 7:48 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Hmm well okay
3/10/25, 7:49 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Gemini have the power to destroy two planets
3/10/25, 7:51 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Virgo sometimes despise Libra because they feel like I usually let Gemini go unpunished and unnoticed despite their atrocities and their need for us respectively
3/10/25, 7:51 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: And Leo be like these people are hurting why do you sometimes love them than me despite all
3/10/25, 7:52 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Zodiac 🙄
3/10/25, 7:52 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Well I guess like they say love is stupid, blind, foolish and needs no reason to start but just reasons to stay so
3/10/25, 7:52 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Have ever thought that maybe Geminis are hurt as much
3/10/25, 7:53 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: It is
3/10/25, 7:53 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I love Gemini just because of 1 reason and that reason has kinda blinded me or corrupted my brain
3/10/25, 7:54 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yes my subconsious tells me so. Especially the older ones (note: you are excluded cause you are the younger one 😅😅)
3/10/25, 7:55 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Sometimes Libra is not giving them attention just like most other signs.
3/10/25, 7:55 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Hahaha
3/10/25, 7:56 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yet they say they are their love and all. But yeah we truly love them me in particular
3/10/25, 7:58 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Okay oh
3/10/25, 7:58 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Good night 🌆😴
3/10/25, 7:59 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah you need to rest and prepare for tomorrow
3/10/25, 7:59 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But I got a question for you
3/10/25, 8:07 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Okay,
3/10/25, 8:08 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: With all the bad things people have to say about Gemini ♊, how do you feel about that
3/10/25, 8:08 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Cause I remember last time you were so dismissive when you heard all the bad things they had to say about Gemini in that video
3/10/25, 8:10 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Some times it hurts because I'm quite sensitive emotionally. but I mean it doesn't change who I am as a person. And if those things are true about my personality then it's intentional
3/10/25, 8:10 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Haha don't mind me
3/10/25, 8:11 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: *not intentional
3/10/25, 8:16 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I love that cause me I want to tell you something when people love you ans accept you despite your weakness or bad sides you got to also accept yourself to. Despite all what I can ever know about Gemini I already love them.

Let ger this on an individual level, people are not perfect and have weaknesses and have even good sides that people can even judge to be bad talk less of their real bad sides and me I love you no matter what, however you are or maybe (even with what I might not know yet). You are you and you are best just how you are. Yeah sure you already do but please love yourself more so we or let me be precise I can love and keep loving you. Always look up cause that's where you are and especially with tomorrow and any other obstacles that will come always keep your head up cause that generally motivate people more to be there for you. But do it for yourself self first and talking about the good selfish, please I ask you to be a little bit selfish and do somethings for you. So please tomorrow be in front of that jury for you and you first and for most.
3/10/25, 8:17 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah it's normal for it to hurt, just know that people will always say a lot
3/10/25, 8:17 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Do you know the Zodiac sign that worries me and sometimes people could think I hate it I just told them one part of a story ?
3/10/25, 8:27 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: How much of French can you understand from a voice?
3/10/25, 8:30 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: That's true, and it really affected me during my secondary school days
3/10/25, 8:31 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: As much as I can 😂, I can only promise to do my best
3/10/25, 8:37 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Thank you so much, I really appreciate you❤️❤️, and I am going to do my best tomorrow with all my nervousness

You are confusing my head with to much sense 😔

4/6/25, 1:20 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I like your approach to the project
4/6/25, 1:20 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: So did you have fun?
4/6/25, 1:23 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I did , overall

4/6/25, 1:26 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: On which day ?

4/6/25, 1:27 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Thursday
4/6/25, 1:27 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Nope like a single verse for example John 3:16, so the fastest flipper to read it out gets the point
4/6/25, 1:28 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Can you please explain how you proceeded with this. Like getting to them and method of asking for informations
4/6/25, 1:29 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Mostly interviews since that's all they could grant me last week, because there's no existing platform in Cameroon
4/6/25, 1:30 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: But they showed me some officiating documents, but I couldn't snap them. So this week I want to push my luck and do so
4/6/25, 1:30 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: How did you get their info in the first place?
4/6/25, 1:30 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I went to their office na

4/6/25, 1:32 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I see, that just simplified it for you 

I can see another A grade coming your way 😉
4/6/25, 1:32 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I hope so 🤞🏽😊, but it seems I'll use block chain technology
4/6/25, 1:33 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah that's what's supposed to happen

4/6/25, 7:12 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Oh my God, if I even dream of it, I'll wake up with annoyance
4/6/25, 7:13 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Because you are saying what I don't like
4/6/25, 7:13 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Please do not dream of it
4/6/25, 7:14 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Oh 😱, I didn't know it was a bad thing to talk about it children. I guess I pushed it to far. Too typical of me 😞

Not talking specifically of twins though
4/6/25, 7:22 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Ehn alright. But people think I'm weird for it. But I actually love children and twins but I don't want twins for myself realistically
4/6/25, 7:22 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I am not longer talking about twins ♊
4/6/25, 7:23 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I am just talking of this way of thinking, they think like this and I always laugh 🤣 at them at the end.

4/6/25, 7:40 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Nothing, that picture just didn't have me smiling in it
4/6/25, 7:43 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah but the smile still looks forced, like just for the sake o the picture. Or its just the caraman's fault
4/6/25, 7:44 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: To be honest, I felt bad that I lost
4/6/25, 7:45 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I thought as much but I didn't want to bring it back
4/6/25, 7:45 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Yeah, you can bring it up. I'm an adult lol, trying not to shy away from my problems

4/6/25, 8:20 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Woww, lucky her. And mixed feelings come from over thinking
4/6/25, 8:20 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah 😂, but I know how to handle that from her.
4/6/25, 8:21 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Haha that's good
4/6/25, 8:23 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: So are you telling me it's just the competition making you to overthink or is there something else ?
4/6/25, 8:25 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: It is, cause I practiced really good althrough the week. So it makes me feel like I lost because I was a designated looser, or I'm not good enough. And thoughts like that get mixed with me telling myself I should not worry because there are days like this
4/6/25, 8:27 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Mom there is always something better than us. And some days we lose not because we are bad. Maybe it was a little moment of lack of concentration that led to that
4/6/25, 8:28 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: How about we put that practice to good use ?
4/6/25, 8:29 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Definitely 😄
4/6/25, 8:30 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: So how about you site me some of those verses then we talk about it and look at lessons or messages from it

4/6/25, 9:49 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Ok I see 😊
4/6/25, 9:50 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: <Media omitted>
4/6/25, 9:50 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Still finding it hard to get a lesson from here
4/6/25, 9:50 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Me too
4/6/25, 9:50 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Wait 🫷
4/6/25, 9:51 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I'm waiting
4/6/25, 9:52 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Psalm 91:7 says, “A thousand may fall at my side, ten thousand at my right hand, but it will not come near me.”
4/6/25, 9:53 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Yup I like it.
My comfort verse is Exodus 14 : 14 actually
4/6/25, 9:54 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah 😂 you will drop that one letter, let's start Here
4/6/25, 9:54 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: So what do you learn from Psalm 91:7?
4/6/25, 9:54 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Exodus 14:14 The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."

Because I get stressed about any inconvenience
4/6/25, 9:56 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I feel like king David was trying to reaffirm how confident he was in God even in the face of his enemies who seemed to have outnumbered him
4/6/25, 9:57 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Ok me I see it more as staying in the path of rightousnes and avoiding temptation no matter what
4/6/25, 9:57 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I combined this more with that book the 7 habits of highly effective people
4/6/25, 9:58 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: True and I read in a book of recently that your biggest enemy is yourself when tempted
4/6/25, 9:59 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Title?
4/6/25, 10:00 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Understanding Divine direction
4/6/25, 10:01 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: And it makes sense
4/6/25, 10:01 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Of course it does
4/6/25, 10:02 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: In a way I see like especially when God has already chosen you. You need not worry cause sometimes that worrying and overthinking can lead you to doubt him and leave room for the devil.

So in some situations learn to sit behind and let him take care of fights for you
4/6/25, 10:04 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I don't doubt God , I doubt myself in my own case . But yeah it's all about learning to trust not just God but oneself too
4/6/25, 10:08 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: 1 John 4:20 He who says loves God but doesn't love their brother is a liar. How can you claim you love God who you have never seen
4/6/25, 10:09 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Self explained 😏
4/6/25, 10:10 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: How can you claim so when you can't put it in writing 🥱😒😂?
4/6/25, 10:10 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Oya write it down 👇
4/6/25, 10:14 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Okay oh

Well Ive never seen God and yet I know he is real through his creations so the text emphasizes on loving everything one around since they are God's creation
4/6/25, 10:14 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: You could go deeper <This message was edited>
4/6/25, 10:16 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: 🥲 eh eh
4/6/25, 10:17 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah even when they make you angry and can be annoying like me sometimes. Before you pray to God and tell him all sweet things forgive them in your heart ❤️
4/6/25, 10:20 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I'm glad you called out yourself 😂😂. But I'm more annoying than you so it really balances everything
4/6/25, 10:20 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Let peach reign before love can lead 😉
4/6/25, 10:21 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: But yeah really good point.
4/6/25, 10:21 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Well you are a Gemini 😜♊ so I understand 😄

4/6/25, 10:22 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Don't bring zodiac here 🙄, don't even try it
4/6/25, 10:22 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Are you annoyed 😅
4/6/25, 10:22 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: No😂😂
4/6/25, 10:22 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I just said One thing not many
4/6/25, 10:22 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Please let's focus on Bible
4/6/25, 10:23 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: But that's how it starts
4/6/25, 10:23 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: No I already promised to stop
4/6/25, 10:24 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I don't if you can keep it. It's something you really like talking about 
I forgive already 😮‍💨
4/6/25, 10:24 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Next verse please 🥺
4/6/25, 10:25 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: NIV, Psalms 27:14
Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.
4/6/25, 10:26 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: God time is the best
4/6/25, 10:26 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: NIV, Proverbs 4:23
Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.
4/6/25, 10:26 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But just like father said in church 2 Sundays ago, while waiting don't sit idle. Cause the Bible also condemns idleness
4/6/25, 10:27 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Be doing something waiting for the Lord
4/6/25, 10:27 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: For example amongst the children of Jesse, David was the one who was chosen as king of Israel
4/6/25, 10:27 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Calm down 😅
4/6/25, 10:28 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: I'll be sleeping soon that's why
4/6/25, 10:28 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: 💯💯💯
4/6/25, 10:28 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Well let finish with this one and do one more then you can rest and we continue tomorrow
4/6/25, 10:28 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Alright
4/6/25, 10:30 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Something to add ?
4/6/25, 10:31 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Yeah, so times it's hard waiting. And I guess it's human nature but when you lean on the assurance in that verse it serves as a motivation to stay patient
4/6/25, 10:33 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: This way you will not even notice that you are waiting
4/6/25, 10:33 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I have my metaphor for this
4/6/25, 10:34 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Proverb 15:1 A gentle answer quietens anger, but a harsh one stir it up
4/6/25, 10:34 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Yeah, but me I'll notice 😂
4/6/25, 10:36 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Hmm I kinda prefer the book of Proverbs to Psalms. It just feels right 

But I feel like it depends on the situation
4/6/25, 10:37 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I love them both and yeah I share same opinion
4/6/25, 10:39 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: You like imitation 😒😂
4/6/25, 10:40 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: You are the one reading my mind and imitating me
4/6/25, 10:40 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah but you still haven't said anything
4/6/25, 10:40 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: What do you think, do you ever get angry even 🤔 
I really get scared of people who I've never seen angry or annoyed
4/6/25, 10:41 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I had that same way of thinking 🤔
4/6/25, 10:41 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Truth is I have learned to convert energy
4/6/25, 10:41 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Swallow it back 🤣. You imitate almost everything
4/6/25, 10:41 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Convertor
4/6/25, 10:41 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Law of conservation of energy 🤕
4/6/25, 10:41 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I learned in the past that it doesn't pay
4/6/25, 10:42 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But according to my twin sister, in her words "You should be scared". I will add to that do not be worried ☹️
4/6/25, 10:42 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: It's self explained. A gentle response let's out more steam and brings peace
4/6/25, 10:43 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: So if I provoke you, you got to keep calm 🤠
4/6/25, 10:43 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Adding how??
4/6/25, 10:44 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Be scared but don't be worried.
4/6/25, 10:44 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: For weh😂 I'll burst cry
4/6/25, 10:44 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: It's the same thing, deep down
4/6/25, 10:45 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Interesting
4/6/25, 10:45 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Not really same. She saw me angry once and I could see her terrified but knowing I couldn't hurt her she was not worried.

There is a slight difference
4/6/25, 10:45 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: So I chosed Shalom
4/6/25, 10:46 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Alright then
4/6/25, 10:47 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Me too. But one thing I don't like is people looking for trouble when I'm not doing so cause I really avoid trouble with everything in me. But it's life
4/6/25, 10:48 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: I prefer people think am dumb or weak
4/6/25, 10:48 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: So you can proof them wrong at the right time
4/6/25, 10:49 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: But with the way I spend most of my childhood if the person is older than me, I retaliate like with Uncle black once in a while. I don't like terrorising people younger than me. I prefer going toe to toe with bigger and stronger 💪
4/6/25, 10:49 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Yeah
4/6/25, 10:50 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: 😂😂 makes sense
4/6/25, 10:51 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: Good night

4/8/25, 2:04 PM - Tabot Charles Bessong II💞: And what about transfer ownership when someone buys a land from someone
4/8/25, 2:06 PM - Ma-Tabot 💞💗: Yeah, stuffs last. I'm leaving. They're only giving land history and law constitution
